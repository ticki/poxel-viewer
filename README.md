# Poxel-viewer - Pixel-based voxel viewer

Poxel¹ (**P**ixel V**oxel**) is a way of rendering 3D-like graphics through a 2D
interface by layering sprites. It is easily to implement, relatively cheap to
render, editable through a voxel editor (for example,
[goxel](https://github.com/guillaumechereau/goxel) and
[vox2png](https://github.com/StijnBrouwer/vox2png)), and finally has a very
unique style to it.

This repository contains a small program which reads a BMP file and allows you
to view the output:

¹I coined this term as I couldn't find anything existing. However the idea is
not new, it appears to have used in a handful of games before (e.g. Lisa the
dog).
